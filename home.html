                    <h5 class="card-title">CHICKEN BULGOGI (KOREAN BBQ CHICKEN)</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Chicken bulgogi is an easy and quick Korean BBQ chicken recipe made with gochujang. You can grill this slightly sweet and savory chicken, broil it in the oven, or pan-fry it. Perfect for a weeknight dinner! <br>Grill: Brush the hot grill grates with oil and lay the chicken on top. Grill for 3-4 minutes each side turning only once.
                        Broil: Put an oven shelving at 5-6 inch below the heat source, preheat the oven to broil. Place a greased cooling rack on a large baking sheet (half sheet size), lay the chicken pieces without overlapping. Broil 4-5 minutes on each side. Make sure to keep an eye on your chicken so that you don’t char them too much.
                        Pan-Fry: Heat a tablespoon of oil on a non-stick surface skillet over high heat, add chicken pieces without crowding the space. You might need to pan-fry chicken in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until chicken is fully cooked. If the sauce burns and start sticking to the skillet, wipe out with a wet kitchen paper.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Make japchae, the popular Korean glass noodle stir-fry, effortlessly with this easy recipe. With chewy sweet potato noodles, colorful veggies, and tender meat, this dish delivers the authentic taste of Korean japchae without any hassle. <br>Skip Boiling the Noodles: Just let them sit in hot water for a bit. Later, they’ll get cooked in the japchae sauce. This means faster cooking and less mess.
                        One-Pan Veggies: Start by cooking the veggies that take longer, like onions, carrots, and peppers. Then, toss in greens and mushrooms. This way, you cook faster and all the veggies taste great.
                        Use the Meat Juice: After cooking beef, keep the tasty juice in the pan. Mix it with the japchae sauce. It makes the noodles extra flavorful and yummy.
                        Maximizing Leftovers: If you have leftover beef bulgogi, it’s perfect for the japchae recipe, allowing you to bypass the meat preparation step.
                        To make vegetarian japchae: simply omit the beef. The dish remains delicious even without it.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Doenjang jjigae is a staple Korean stew that uses fermented Korean soybean paste to create a deeply flavorful broth accentuated with tofu and fresh vegetables. With the help of my step-by-step photos, preparing this stew at home becomes effortless  <br> Doenjang jjigae is a beloved Korean stew made with soybean paste, often considered the ultimate comfort food alongside kimchi jjigae and sundubu jjigae.

                        Korean restaurants typically serve it as the final course after a meal of Korean pork belly barbecue (samgyupsal), bulgogi, or galbi. The aroma of this authentic Korean stew evokes nostalgia for many Koreans, including myself.I have fond memories of my mother making her signature doenjang stew, which my father adored. Her recipe was special because she made her own doenjang paste, although store-bought paste can still create a delicious stew.

                        If you’re a fan of Korean soups and stews, this recipe is a must-try.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Directions
                        Put rice into a large deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns milky white. Drain cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat three or four times until you can see rice through 3 inches of water; drain once more.
                        
                        Transfer rice to a saucepan; add kombu and 3 cups water. Let stand 30 minutes. Cover; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.
                        
                        Meanwhile, stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved.
                        
                        Remove and discard kombu; stir in vinegar mixture until no lumps remain. Spread rice mixture onto a rimmed 9x13 baking sheet. [Spreading helps cool rice and prevents it from continuing to cook.] Let cool to room temperature.
                        
                        Lay one sheet of nori on a sushi mat lined with plastic wrap; spread 1 cup of rice over nori with damp fingers, leaving a 1-inch border along one edge. Arrange desired fillings (see below) crosswise just off center of rice. Carefully lift filled edge of nori and roll over filling toward unfilled edge, tucking as you roll. Brush unfilled edge of nori with water; press to seal. Cut each roll into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, and fillings. To make ahead, chill, covered, up to 4 hours.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.Chicken Katsu Ingredients
                        These are the ingredients you'll need to make this chicken katsu recipe at home:
                        
                        · Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.
                        · Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.
                        · Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.
                        · Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.
                        · Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.
                        · Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.

                    <p class="card-text">Be sure to use a non-reactive (such as stainless steel, ceramic, glass or metal cookware with enamel coatingl) pan when making the lemon curd.  The acid from the lemon juice can react with aluminum pans giving the end product an off flavor.
                        To quickly cool this mixture, place the bowl of curd  in a large bowl filled with ice water. Stir occasionally, to help cool the mixture. Replace ice as needed and be careful that water from your ice bath does not get into the lemon curd.
                        If you like, you can substitute 2 (12.7 ounce) jars purchased lemon curd or you can make two recipes of Microwave Lemon Curd.</p>
